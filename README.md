# 📌 Nintendo Store Themed Website with PHP CRUD & MySQL

This project is an enhanced version of [my previous project](https://github.com/Razaann/PHP-CRUD-with-Image). It is a Nintendo Store themed website featuring a **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** application built with **PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript**. The website enables users to manage items in a database, with support for image uploads (via URL or local files), a login and registration system, role-based access control, and live product search functionality.
